## Introduction

I have a very versatile knowledge within the Information Technology sector. I have skills in software development, web development, cloud computing, and system engineering. I always aim for 100% when coming to assessments to get a complete understanding of how things work.

## How did I get here...

When I was in primary school, I was obsessed with computers. Since then, I have been a troubleshooter whenever my teachers have computer problems. It had led me to take a Bachelor of Information Technology course at Otago Polytechnic, and I found a strong interest in programming. I have developed many skills, such as time management and working in an agile team environment making software and web applications.

I did not know what I wanted to do when I graduated, so I decided to take a break. A couple of years later, I went back to studying and took the Diploma for Graduates in Information Technology at the University of Otago to gain connections within the industry, where I developed soft skills that would carry into my career. My pathway in this course is cloud engineering and virtualisation.

## Interests

I am a person who is always up for a challenge. Since 2021, I've been exercising to try to lose weight; I have achieved that by having a balanced diet and going for long-distance runs.

I also have a bit of creativity; when cooking, I make delicious authentic dishes that I enjoy eating, such as Butter Chicken and Meatballs. Also likes to design visual artboards using Adobe Illustrator and having to redecorate a house over the past two Summers.
