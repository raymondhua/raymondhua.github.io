## Introduction

I have a very versatile knowledge within the Information Technology sector. I have skills in software development, web development, cloud computing, and system engineering. I always aim for 100% when coming to assessments to get a complete understanding of how things work.

## How did I get here...

When I was in primary school, I was obsessed with computers. Since then, I have been a troubleshooter whenever my teachers have computer problems. It had led me to take a Bachelor of Information Technology course at Otago Polytechnic, and I found a strong interest in programming. I have developed many skills, such as time management and working in an agile team environment making software and web applications.

I did not know what I wanted to do when I graduated, so I decided to take a break. A couple of years later, I went back to studying and took the Diploma for Graduates in Information Technology at the University of Otago to build further connections within the industry and developed soft skills that would carry into my career. My pathway in this course was cloud engineering and virtualisation.
