## Summary


## Integriti project

The main project of my placement was creating a virtual machine on Azure, installing the access-control service (ACS), Integriti and migrating configurations from the existing on-premises infrastructure. 

It is the ongoing part of MMSâ€™ migration to the cloud to reduce on-premises maintenance and costs of maintaining and replacing dated infrastructure.

My tasks were:

* **Creating a virtual machine**: 
* **Hardening and penetrate systems**: 
* **Migrating controllers**: The controllers exist in multiple locations in the South Island.

## VBA project


* **Researching what VBA is**: 
* **Developing date validation feature**: 
* **Testing the feature**:
